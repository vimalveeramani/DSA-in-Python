## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-in-Python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository:

   ```bash
   cd DSA-in-Python
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any). You can use a virtual environment like `venv` or `conda`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Explore the code! The implementations are organized into separate directories for data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of various data structures, such as:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented in its own Python module and provides methods for common operations.

## Algorithms

This section contains implementations of various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- [BubbleSort](#BubbleSort.py) 
- Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python module and provides methods for solving specific problems.
